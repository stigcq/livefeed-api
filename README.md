# livefeed-api

This in an implementation of my livefeed api made with note.js, express and mongodb. 

The livefeed api is basicly a messaging system made for usage for livefeeds, that is
a feed of messages that updates regularly. 

The current php implementation with js/jquery frontend can be seen here:

Purpose of this is to clearly seperate backend from frontend and hence
make it a genuine JAMStack app.
